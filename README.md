# SQL_for_School

This is a simple project to make a database for a school. Everyone is able to use it. I use two different files to manage the information of the students. There are Python file and a Jupyter Notebook.

By using the python file, they can easily put input in it. In Jupyter Notebook, we can just look for the function we want. 

Since there are many students in every school, they should use a program to manage the information and it can save lots of time.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

The data contains basic information of the students.

The table contains the first names, last name, grade, and the e-mail address of the students.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
